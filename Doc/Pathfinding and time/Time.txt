How am I gonna deal with units trying to perform the same task:
  moving to the same tile
  building something in the same tile
  picking things up from the same tile

I don't like unit order, because it can give the first units different behaviour compared to the later ones.

Ideally, the game would execute all the units at the same time (all-together-execution).
  But some times, the actions can collide, like when 2 units move to the same tile, or try to pick up the same thing.

So I will have to define an order for those cases.

In order to make order more democratic I will constantly change it.
  So there will not be first-units and last-units.

Even though there are collitions, the important thing about all-together-execution is that units don't take into account
  what other units do in the same frame.

Note that there are 2 ways of implementing the all-together-execution.
  Executing the a phase where all units decide their actions, and then the second where they actually perform them.
  Having 2 copies of the map, the current-one and the next-one.
    Which is the current or futere map will switch constantly in each frame.

I like more the second because it doesn't require stopping all the threads in the middle of the frame in order to start the second phase.

For multithreading I will have to put all units that could potentially interact in the same thread.
  And I will also have to be careful with order reassigning.
