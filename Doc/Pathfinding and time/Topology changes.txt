So the big issue is:
  what to do if the topology changes?
  If I force the unit to go to a certain chunk, I may be forcing it to travel a gigantic path.

The solution is to remember how far away that chunk was, if an obstacles appears and the distance becomes grater
  than it was before, then the whole path is recalculated.
