Before finding a path, the unit has to find a destination.
For instance, if a unit wants to gather a specific resource,
  how is it going to find it?

I could indicate how many resources there are in each chunk in each level.

But that would have a similar problem to HPF with Chunk Confinment.
The problem is that the unit will prefere to go to the other corner of the megachunk
  instead of going to an adjacent megachunk, even if it is 2 tiles away.

I can remove CC from my HPF implementation, and I can do something similar for finding destinations.
Let's say I em looking for gold.
I check whether there is gold in my chunk0
If not I check whether there is gold in my chunk1
I keep on like that, and finaly, I see that there is gold in my chunk5
Now, I start a A* looking for a chunk4 with gold, and if is in a different chunk5, it does not matter.







if the unit has gold and it is looking for more gold. I could decrease the amount of gold in its chunks, execute the gold search, and then increase it again.
