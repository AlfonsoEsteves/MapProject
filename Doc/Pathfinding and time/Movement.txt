There will not be unit collision because of a main reason:
  When the first unit of a group of units gets into a corridor, all the other units will consider the corridor blocked.

Secondary reason:
  I have to update very frequently the HPF matrices.

How am I gonna deal with groups of units clumped together?
  Maybe I could make one of the units in the group remain behind, maybe the first to acquire its turn would be the easiest thing to implement.




Note: making all paths backtrackable is important for pathfinding, so I shouldn't allow units throw themselves over cliffs.
