Units may want to deposit a resource in the nearest depot or unit that looks for that resource



items that are peaces of behaviour that can be used to create new units








if blue close
  persue
if red close
  attack




part of the behaviour is protect item or unit





if child is close
jump 2
create child
if has red
jump 2
jump 6
if has blue
jump 2
jump 6
create purple
jump 4
search red
jump 2
search blue




I LIKE THIS WAY OF CODIFICAR:

//Simple
if child is near then skip 1
create child
if has red then skip 1
search red
if has blue then skip 1
search blue
create purple

//A little more sofisticated
if child is near then skip 1
create child
if has red then skip 2
if there is no red near skip 1
search red
if has blue then skip 1
search blue
if has red then skip 1
search red
create purple

//Simple, specifying the child
if child is near then skip 1
create child
    search red
    give to creator
    search blue
    give to creator
if has red then skip 1
search red
if has blue then skip 1
search blue
create purple


if child is near then skip 1
create child
    search red
    give to creator
    search blue
    give to creator
search red
search blue
create purple







search [resource] if [distance] near
create [unit] if there is none [distance] near
create [resource]
