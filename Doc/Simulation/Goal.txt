For this first version,
  the goal is to create a lot of emergent behaviour with the simplest mechanics possible.
  It doesn't matter if things are 100% abstract and don't make any human sense.

Maybe a good subgoal is trying to have both:
  groups of units that settle in a good place
  groups of units that migrate (but the group remains)
