I want emergent behaviour.

I think:
  To create emergent behaviour there has to be a balance between static and volatile things.

If things are to static, new structures will not appear.

If things are to volatile structures will last just a short time.

So...
I want units to have a predifined behaviour, but that can change now and then.

I also want units to be able to create new units, I think that that could bring a lot of emergent behaviour.
  And I want the creator unit to also predifine the behaviour of its created units.

This is an example of how to implement such thing:

Unit 1:
red
blue
blue
*mark*
green
blue
*mark*

That unit would look for red, then for blue, then for blue again, and then it would try to create
  a new unit that looks for green and then for blue, and then it would start the cycle again.
