When a unit picks up a resource, it puts it insede its bag.
The unit can perform different operations with its bag contente:
  combine
  create unit
  release

The rest of the operations are:
search [resource] [distance] 
go to parent
attack [unit]

Conditinals:
if [resource] [closeness]
if [parent] [closeness]


When a complex unit is picked up:
  will it be put at the end of the block, entirely, or just the resource it represents??
    I think the resource it represents, which could be complex
