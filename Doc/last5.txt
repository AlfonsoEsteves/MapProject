When a unit picks up a resource, it puts it insede its bag.
The unit can perform different operations with its bag contente:
  combine
  create unit
  release

The rest of the operations are:
search [resource] [distance] 
go to parent
attack [unit]

Conditinals:
if [resource] [closeness]
if [parent] [closeness]


When a complex unit is picked up:
  will it be put at the end of the block, entirely, or just the resource it represents??
    I think the resource it represents, which could be complex

Maybe the best thing is to allow units to take away resources from other units intead of letting them give.
  Because giving resources can break the desired sequence in the receiving unit





how am I gonna insert specific instructions like: combine, conditions, createUnit???
  well
    I coul have an instruction that is: "convert last resource into a specific instration"
