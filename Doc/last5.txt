When a unit picks up a resource, it puts it insede the next block in the steps. Right before the closing bracket.

search red
search blue
create unit{
}

That example would insert in the block a red, then a blue, and then it would create a red>blue unit, and it would empty its block.

Giving resource is similar

search red
search blue
give resource to parent{
}





search unit
create unit
give unit to parent
give unit to any
attack unit


When a complex unit is picked up:
  will it be put at the end of the block, entirely, or just the resource it represents??
    I think the resource it represents, which could be complex
